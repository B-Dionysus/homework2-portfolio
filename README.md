# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
[Github Page here](https://b-dionysus.github.io/homework2-portfolio/index.html)

Three page site with an about page, a contact page, and a portflio page displaying responsive images. All pages should be responive.

For this project, I tried to avoid using javascipt for layout, and to minimize original css for layout as wellâ€”the goal was to do as much via Bootstrap's native classes as possible. Obviously I had to use a little of my own css, and I used javascript to create some sweet modal thubnail expansions in the portfolio page.
